need to make some way to decide if the game is using the standard mapset or loading a custom map
unsure if it should be in the sokoban state itself or a larger appstate value
leaning towards appstate

- make sure to record number of moves taken to finish the level and note it down as a high score that can be tracked and replaced if a better one is achieved

main menu will have

Play Sokoban
 - Play Classic Level Pack
 - Play Custom Level
Level Editor
Quit

FOR RIGHT NOW
just have menu and playing and I guess have the appstate keep track of the max level
